# Rishik KNR — Founder Portfolio

This repository contains the source code for my **personal founder portfolio website**.

This is **not a resume website**.  
It is a **founder-first digital identity** designed to communicate how I think, build, and lead — at the intersection of **technology, trust, scale, and impact**.

The site presents my journey as a **builder and entrepreneur**, highlights my core ventures, and separates engineering depth from founder narrative for clarity and authenticity.

## 🌑 Design Philosophy

- **Theme:** Deep black background with subtle light-blue accents  
- **Aesthetic:** Minimal, premium, Apple-inspired  
- **Tone:** Calm confidence, clarity over noise  
- **Focus:** Story, impact, and intent — not buzzwords  

Every design decision prioritizes:
- Authenticity over hype  
- Narrative over bullet points  
- Founder mindset over job-seeker framing

## 🧭 Website Structure

### Home
A clear founder identity — who I am, what I build, and why it matters.

### Founder Journey
A narrative view of my evolution from engineer to builder to founder, shaped by real-world problems and execution-driven learning.

### Ventures
Core ventures that define my work:
- **Sanchaya** — Trust infrastructure for India’s informal savings ecosystem  
- **Revive** — AI-powered rural healthcare platform  
- **NeuroDam** — Climate and flood prediction intelligence system  

Each venture is presented as a **problem → solution → impact story**, not a pitch deck.

### Achievements
Recognitions, competitions, and milestones presented factually and without exaggeration.

### Engineering
A separate, optional section for those interested in my technical depth, systems thinking, and architecture mindset.  
Engineering is treated as a **tool**, not the identity.

### Contact
Direct and intentional communication:
- Email
- LinkedIn

No forms. No noise.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (Flexible)

The implementation is intentionally lightweight and adaptable.  
Can be built using:
- React / Next.js / Vite
- Tailwind CSS
- Framer Motion (for subtle animations)
- Deployed on Vercel / Netlify

The stack serves the **story**, not the other way around.

## 🎯 Purpose

This portfolio is built for:
- Business schools & scholarship committees  
- Founders, mentors, and ecosystem leaders  
- Collaborators who value execution and clarity  

It is designed to answer one question clearly:

> *“Is this someone already thinking and operating like a founder?”*
