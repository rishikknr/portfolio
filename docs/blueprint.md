## Style Guidelines:

- Background color: Deep matte black / near-black (#0B0D10) to create a premium, sophisticated feel.
- Primary color: Soft, premium light blue / cyan glow (#ADD8E6) to serve as the main accent color and provide a calm, modern feel.
- Accent color: A slightly darker, more saturated shade of cyan (#77B5FE) used sparingly to highlight key interactive elements and call-to-actions, ensuring they stand out without disrupting the site's understated aesthetic.
- Headings font: 'Inter', a modern sans-serif font, to give a clean and elegant look. Using it for headings gives an organized and easily readable layout.
- Body font: 'PT Sans', a clean and readable sans-serif with a slightly lighter weight, provides a comfortable reading experience without sacrificing clarity or professionalism. Using 'PT Sans' makes the content easily accessible and helps maintain a serious tone.
- Minimal icons should be used and their color will match the primary color.
- Employ large whitespace to create a sense of space and premium restraint, ensuring the content is uncluttered and easy to navigate.
- Use subtle animations, such as smooth scrolling and soft hover effects, to add a layer of sophistication without being distracting.
